# Le_Baguette
Bot for RLBot, this is the ML Bot, it is supposed to be working from trial and error, but i keep facing issues.

# Instalation and use

to install Le_Baguette: 

install RLBot,
then extract or clone Le_Baguette in the agent folder, make sure it is in a folder,
so everything stays in one folder. make sure to call it `Le_Baguette`.

up to this point, follow RLBot instructions to start the bot.

The bot might take some time to start because of tensorflow import and other heavy tasks. On my computer, it takes about a minute and half to start.

Happy ... what is it at this point ? Have a good time while watching bot play for you ?
