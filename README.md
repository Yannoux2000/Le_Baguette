# Le Baguette (Par of the Boulangerie Bot Family) :

Welcome to Le Baguette's Repo, one of the few bots in the RLBot Community, that represente his origin country (Kinda). This bot is part of the bot family : Le Boulangerie, twin of [Le Croissant](https://github.com/inXS212/Le_Croissant). Le Baguette is **MACHINE LEARNING** meaning it is using algorithms that are intended to provoque emergent behaviours on purpose.

~~I do not take responsibilities on any revolution/genocide of the human race, provoked by the mis-usage of theses algorithm. They are presented in this repo, in educative and personal intentions.~~

# Instalation and use :

To install and run Le Baguette, you will need :

	- [RLBot](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot), because it is useless without an environment.
	- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot), because it is useless without an environment.

Conciderer checking out the RLBot repository, to fully understand the designing behind this bot.
